description: Xcode build verification preference
---

When you need to verify a build:
1. Do NOT run `xcodebuild` commands from the terminal - they are slow
2. Instead, prompt the user to run the build manually in Xcode
3. Wait for the user to report any compilation errors
4. Fix reported errors as needed
